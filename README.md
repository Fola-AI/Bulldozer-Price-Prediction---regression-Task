### 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate regression models that can accurately predict bulldozer prices.

#### Problem Statement

How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and historical sales data?

Dataset

There are three main datasets:

Train.csv → Training set (data up to 2011).

Valid.csv → Validation set (Jan 2012 – Apr 2012).

Test.csv → Test set (May 2012 – Nov 2012, released at competition end).

Kaggle also provides a data dictionary
 describing the dataset features.

The goal is to minimize RMSLE.

### 🔑 Key Steps in the Notebook

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Distribution plots of key features.

Handling missing values and categorical features.

Feature Engineering:

Converting date columns to datetime.

Creating new time-based features.

### Modeling:

Training regression models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).

Hyperparameter tuning.

Evaluation:

Comparing model performance using RMSLE.

Generating predictions on validation/test sets.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.9+

Libraries:

pandas, numpy → Data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn → Visualization

scikit-learn → Machine learning models

xgboost / lightgbm → Advanced gradient boosting methods

jupyter → Interactive environment

### 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/BulldozerPricePrediction.git
cd BulldozerPricePrediction


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Regression_BulldozerPricePrediction.ipynb

### 📊 Results

The project demonstrates how tree-based models like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting perform well on structured data.

Feature engineering (especially handling dates and categorical variables) significantly improves accuracy.

Achieved a competitive RMSLE score comparable to Kaggle benchmarks.

### 📌 Future Improvements

Implement deep learning models for regression.

Use stacked/ensemble models for better generalization.

Automate hyperparameter tuning with Optuna or Bayesian Optimization.

Deploy the trained model as an API or simple web app.
